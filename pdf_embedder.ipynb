This is achieved by finding the best deletion (facility to be removed) during the evaluation of the objective function value, reducing the complexity of the procedure.\\n\\nTo adapt the Fast Vertex Substitution to the alpha-neighbor p-center problem, you can incorporate the concept of alpha-neighborhood into the procedure. The alpha-neighborhood of a solution X is defined as the set of solutions that can be obtained by replacing at most alpha fraction of the facilities in X with facilities outside of X.\\n\\nIn the Fast Vertex Substitution, instead of considering all possible replacements of facilities, you can limit the replacements to only those that result in solutions within the alpha-neighborhood of X. This can be done by modifying the Move procedure to consider only those replacements that satisfy the alpha-neighborhood constraint.\\n\\nBy incorporating the alpha-neighborhood constraint, you can ensure that the Fast Vertex Substitution explores a more restricted search space, focusing on solutions that are more likely to improve the objective function value. This can potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the alpha-neighbor p-center problem.'"
